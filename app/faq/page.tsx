        q: "How many companies are in the database?",

      {
        q: "Is the data limited to Nigeria?",

      },
      {
        q: "How often is the database updated?",
        a: "The database is updated on a rolling basis. High-demand industries and major cities are refreshed more frequently. If you encounter a contact that appears outdated, you can flag it from within the platform and our team will review it.",

        q: "Do you offer a refund if I'm not satisfied?",
